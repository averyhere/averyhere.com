Users could also choose a followup action - either defaulting what is configured in the Marketo form, showing a followup message, or redirecting the user to another URL.</p>\n<p>The plugin also output the Marketo Form without including Marketo's heavy MktoForms2.js javascript library on load. Instead, forms were generated using VueJS and submitted securely through the lazy-loaded javascript library. This enabled a better UX for site visitors, faster load times, and a reduction to Page Speed Insights Content Layout Shift scores as forms are rendered immediately. All while retaining and utilizing the very same secure dataflow utilized in native embedded Marketo Forms.</p>",
