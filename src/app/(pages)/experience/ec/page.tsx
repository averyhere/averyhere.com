            The initiative was a great success. The headless foundation was utilized to build and launch three headless websites between November, 2024 and January, 2025. Page speed scores were 90+ for both desktop and mobile. Load times were consistently under 1.2 seconds. Content managers were very happy with the speed, and ability to use a familiar CMS (WordPress).

          <p className="my-2">
            Heap Analytics proved to be an incredibly valuable tool. We deployed, onboarded, migrated, and launched Heap across all 50 of our company's marketing web properties within 6 months of start.
          </p>
          <p className="my-2">
            The following year, I worked with our central product team to assist in modifying our user guide and deploying Heap Analytics into various EverCommerce subsidiary products. This enabled our product teams with improved product analytics, and enabled our entire organization with the ability to track the entire customer lifecycle.
